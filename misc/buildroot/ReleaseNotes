This is a highly hacked up version of the buildroot (see
http://buildroot.uclibc.org/ . It has been hacked so that it
can be used to build the following NuttX-compatible toolchains:

    NXP LPC214x (ARM7TMDI), STMicro STR71x (ARM7TDMI), Freescale
    i.MX1 (ARM920T), and TI DM320 (ARM926EJ-S) provided with the
    NuttX releases.

  o arm-elf (thumb2) toolchain needed for use with the Luminary
    LM3S6918 (ARM Cortex-M3) port provided with the NuttX releases.

    NXFLAT toolchain for use with the ARM Cortex-M3.

  o avr-elf toolchain needed for use with the ATmega128 ports
    provided with the NuttX releases.

  o m68k-elf toolchain (not currently used in any NuttX
    configuration).

  o m68hc11-elf toolchain (not currently used in any NuttX
    configuration).

  o sh-elf toolchain needed for the SH-1 NuttX port.

  o m32c-elf toolchain needed for the Renesas M16C NuttX port.

  o H8/300 toolchain (not currently used in any NuttX
    configuration).

  o bfin-elf toolchain not currently used in any NuttX
    configuration).

Supported tool versions include:

  o gcc-3.4.6 + binutils-2.17
  o gcc-4.2.4 + binutils-2.19
  o gcc-4.3.3 + binutils-2.19.1

See the ChangeLog of features/architectgures added in v0.1.5.

Installation instructions:

  - You must have already configured Nuttx in <some-dir>/nuttx
  - download the buildroot package into <some-dir>
  - unpack -cd <some-dir>/buildroot
  - cp configs/arm-defconfig .config
  - make oldconfig
  - make

See configs/README.txt for other configurations and for more detailed
instructions.  If your NuttX installation resides at a different location
then:

  - make menuconfig

And set the "Path to the NuttX root directory" appropriately.

NXFLAT Toolchain Build

You can select to build the NXFLAT toolchain with GCC by selecting
the NXFLAT toolchin during the configuration process(you can also
select omit building GCC with and only build the NXFLAT toolchain
for use with your own GCC toolchain.
